# Machine-Learning-Course-University-of-Calgary

This repository includes the lectures for Machine Learning â€“ Energy Systems Course at University of Calgary. The materials for this course including required data workflow and notebook are here https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/Machine-Learning-Course-University-of-Calgary. 

## Bio

Dr. Mehdi Rezvandehy is a Data Scientist at Symend. He holds a PhD in Geostatistics from University of Alberta and worked as geomodeller in oil and gas industry. He specializes in data cleaning, feature engineering, data mining, data visualization, regression, classification, clustering.. to improve business performance, customer segmentation and customer treatment.

This course introduces the students to Python programming, applications of machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and optimization in energy systems. Some statistics and probability analysis will be reviewed. Feature Engineering and Data cleaning and data visualizations, supervised and unsupervised learning including regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction and evaluation of model performance will be discussed and implemented in Python during the course.
